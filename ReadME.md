A **Python-based Wordle assistant** that combines probability‑weighted candidate selection with entropy‑driven guess scoring, delivered through a dark‑themed tactical GUI.  
Inspired by [3Blue1Brown’s Wordle video & code](https://github.com/3b1b/videos/tree/e317d6c5eaa8370a2deb4d148c246b0d0e9fbe6f/_2022/wordle).

## What It Does

- **Loads a full Wordle word list** with real‑world frequency‑derived probabilities (Zipf scale → linear weights).
- **Uses a precomputed response‑pattern matrix** (`wordle_full_matrix.npy`) to evaluate every possible guess against every possible secret **instantly**.
- **Scores every guess** by its *expected information gain* (Shannon entropy) and, when appropriate, its *win probability*.
- **Suggests two kinds of moves:**
  - **Strategic Suggestions** – high‑entropy words to **narrow** the remaining answer pool.
  - **Answer Likelihood** – high‑probability candidate words for **final solves**.
- **Tracks your game** in a 6‑row visual progression grid, showing colour‑coded feedback after each guess.
- **Adapts its scoring strategy** as the game progresses (pessimistic early, balanced mid, aggressive late).

## Quick Start (No Python Required)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Muhammad-H-Bakr/Wordle_Solver/releases).
2. Download `Wordle-Strat-Console.exe`.
3. Run the executable – the GUI opens immediately.

> ⚠️ Windows Defender or other antivirus may flag the unsigned `.exe`. The source is fully open – You can exclude it from the defender or build it yourself with pyinstaller from the job written in: `.github/workflows/build-exe.yml`.

## Installation & Running from Source

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Wolv/Wordle_Solver.git
cd Wordle_Solver
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project requires Python 3.12 (specifically 3.12.0 or higher).

### 4. Prepare the Data (first time only)

Quick steps:

```bash
python Data.py
python Matrix_init.py #runs only after Data.py
```

### 5. Launch the Solver

```bash
python GUI.py
```

## How to Use the GUI

The interface is divided into three panels:

| Panel | What it shows |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Left – Mission Progression** | Your last 6 guesses with colour feedback *(green/yellow/grey)*. |
| **Centre – Command Input** | 5-letter guess entry, colour selector buttons, **Submit/Reset** controls. |
| **Right – Intel Report** | Two scrollable lists: **Strategic Suggestions** (top) and **Answer Likelihood** (bottom). |

## Typical Play Session

1. Type a 5‑letter starter (e.g., CRANE) in the input field.

2. Set the feedback for each letter by clicking the colour boxes (G = green, Y = yellow, X = grey).

3. Click SUBMIT. The engine filters the answer pool and refreshes the suggestion lists.

4. Repeat until the pool is narrowed to a single word (or you see “Answer Likelihood” at 100%).

## Resetting

Click the RESET button any time to start a new game (clears state and reloads the full word list).

## Algorithm Deep Dive

### 1. Word Probabilities

`Data.py` fetches the Zipf frequency of every word (a log‑scale measure of how common a word is in real English).
Zipf values are converted to linear weights so they can be treated as probabilities.

The resulting file `scientific_word_data.csv` contains each word and its probability.

### 2. Pattern Matrix

`Matrix_init.py` precomputes every possible (guess, secret) pattern and stores it as a single 2‑D uint8 array.
A pattern is a 5‑tuple of {0=grey, 1=yellow, 2=green} encoded as a base‑3 integer (0‑242).

> This matrix allows the engine to filter the candidate pool with a single vectorised operation.

Storage: ~168 MB for the default word list (≈13,000 × 13,000).

### 3. Entropy Scoring

For each guess, the engine:

A. Extracts the row of the pattern matrix corresponding to that guess, but only for the currently possible answers.

B. Computes the weighted Shannon entropy of the resulting pattern distribution:

>entropy = - Σ p(pattern) × log₂(p(pattern))
where p(pattern) is the sum of the normalised probabilities of all remaining answers that would give that pattern.

C. Combines entropy with the win probability of the guess (if it is a candidate answer) according to a phase‑aware scoring function:

| Turn                         | Strategy                                 | Score Formula                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1–2                          | Pessimistic (pure info-gathering)        | `score = entropy`                      |
| 3–4 and >2 candidates        | Balanced                                 | `score = entropy + 0.05 × win_prob`    |
| ≤2 candidates                | Aggressive                               | `score = entropy + 5.0 × win_prob`     |
| Later (else)                 | Greedy win                               | `score = entropy + 10.0 × win_prob`    |

>This heuristic follows the intuition that early guesses should maximise information (even if they can’t win), while later guesses should prioritise actually hitting the answer.

### 4. State Update

When the user submits a guess and its feedback pattern, the engine simply keeps only those indices from possible_indices where the pre‑stored pattern matches the observed one.

## File Inventory

| File | Purpose | Must Run? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Data.py` | Downloads word frequencies and builds `scientific_word_data.csv` | Once (first-time setup) |
| `Matrix_init.py` | Builds the full pattern matrix `wordle_full_matrix.npy` | Once (after `Data.py`) |
| `Engine.py` | Core solver class (`wordleEngine`) | No (imported by GUI) |
| `GUI.py` | The CustomTkinter desktop application | Entry point |
| `requirements.txt` | All Python packages needed | Install once |
| `scientific_word_data.csv` | Pre-computed word probabilities | Generated (By Data.py) |
| `wordle_full_matrix.npy` | Pre-computed pattern matrix | Generated (By Matrix_init.py) |

## First‑Time Setup (Data Preparation)

The solver needs two files that are stored in this repository but are also avaliable in kaggle:

- `valid_guesses.csv` – list of all allowed guess words.

- `valid_solutions.csv` – list of words that can be the hidden answer.

Reference to them: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/wordle-valid-words/data)

> After `Data.py` runs it produces `scientific_word_data.csv` (contains ~13,000 words with normalised probabilities) which is then fed to `Matrix_init.py` that creates `wordle_full_matrix.npy` (~168 MB). The computation takes a few minutes on a modern CPU. (5-7 minute approx).

Verify that both generated files exist in the root directory if you were running `GUI.py`.

Note: The pre‑built executable already bundles a pre‑computed matrix and everyother thing, no extra required (not even python).

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Wolv/Wordle_Solver.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
